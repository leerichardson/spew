\title{Generic sampling locations function}
\usage{
sample_locations(method, place_id, n_house, shapefile, noise = 0.001,
  shapefile_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{character vector either "uniform" or "roads" determining 
how we are sampling locations}

\item{place_id}{numeric specifiying the ID of the region we are 
subsampling}

\item{n_house}{numeric indicating the number of households}

\item{shapefile}{sp class with all of the locations for each place id. Note 
that this is a list with two shapefiles if me}

\item{noise}{the standard deviation of how much 
we jitter the road locations in each direction (only if method is "roads")}
}
\value{
SpatialPoints object with coordinates for the n households
}
